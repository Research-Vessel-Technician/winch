     TENSION LOW - Slack Line. Tension is too low.
     PAYOUT HI – Too much rope is let out
     PAYOUT LOW – The off board device is getting too close to the vessel.
     SPEED HI - Line is being let out too fast
     SPEED LOW - Line is being pulled in too fast. Note this does NOT mean the rope is setting still; it means the setpoint has been exceeded in the negative direction.
